*** Generating the RPM ***

'make rpm' should work. ;-)

*** Launching the unit test suite ***

'make test' should *not* work!!

You should configure your environment so dependent libraries are
installed. Those libraries are defined in the .spec.

Here is the list (as of version 2.3, this README may not be up to date!):

Standard Lib:
python-graph >= 1.7.0,
pydot >= 1.0.2,
python-lxml >= 2.2.3,
graphviz >= 2.26,
clustershell >= 1.2.83


Standard Lib are easy to install and set-up if you are root on the
machine you want to launch the test suite. You might either use you
package manager (yum, apt-get, whatever) or directly download source
files (use google to find them) and follow the instructions given in
each of them.

- Well almost, some specific tests might fail to run mainly due to
  configuration issue. This is especially true for tests that used ssh
  to some hosts (localhost). You should be able to do a password-less
  ssh to localhost. Some tests use test1 test2 and test3 as host
  names. Set up your ~/.ssh/config accordingly. See the test source
  file for details.

  Also, after an ssh to localhost, the command specified for remote
  execution should be found. If you are in a chrooted environment this
  might not work.

  For example, on atlas, the 'make release' is made in the PDP
  (chrooted). This Makefile target checkout the project into the
  $TMPDIR and launch the test suite. Unfortunately, after the ssh,
  $TMPDIR is not the same. And the test fail. Therefore, you will have
  to set up the TMPDIR accordingly (for exemple in ~/tmp).

For details, you might use:

     nosetest -s

to see what is the output of each test.

Hope it helps!
